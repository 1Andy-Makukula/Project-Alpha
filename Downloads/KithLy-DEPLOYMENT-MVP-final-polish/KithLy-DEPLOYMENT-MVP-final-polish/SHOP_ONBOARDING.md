# KithLy Shop Onboarding Script

**Objective:** To confidently and clearly onboard a new shop owner, explaining the value proposition, the process, and what to expect.

**Target Audience:** Local shop owners (e.g., bakeries, grocery stores, gift shops).

### **Part 1: The Introduction & Value Proposition**

*(Walking into the shop, addressing the owner or manager)*

"Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I'm with KithLy. I'm stopping by because I see you run a wonderful [bakery/shop], and we're helping local businesses like yours connect with a whole new group of customers.

Have you ever had customers who live abroad—say, in the UK or the US—who want to buy things for their family here in [City]?

*(Listen to their response)*

That's exactly what we do. KithLy is a simple platform that lets people living overseas buy your products online as gifts for their loved ones right here. They pay online, and the recipient comes to your shop to collect it.

**For you, it means:**

*   **More Sales:** You get access to a global market of customers who want to support their families locally.
*   **Zero Risk:** The payment is handled securely online before anyone walks into your store. It's guaranteed.
*   **Free Marketing:** We feature your shop on our platform, putting you in front of thousands of potential new customers."

### **Part 2: How It Works (The 3 Simple Steps)**

"It's incredibly simple to get started. Here's how it works:

1.  **We Set Up Your Online Shop:** I can help you right now to get your shop listed on KithLy. We'll take a few photos of your best-selling items, set the prices, and you're ready to go. This takes about 15 minutes.

2.  **A Customer Buys a Gift:** Someone, let's say in London, buys a birthday cake from your shop for their mother here in [City]. You'll get a notification, but you don't have to do anything yet.

3.  **The Recipient Collects:** Their mother receives an SMS with a special collection code. She comes to your shop, shows you the code on her phone, and you give her the cake. You'll have a simple portal on your own phone to verify the code in seconds.

That's it. You get the sale, and a happy local customer walks out with your product."

3.  **Upload Products:**
    *   "Now, let's pick five popular items. What do people love buying here?"
    *   Take clear, well-lit photos with your phone.
    *   "What's the name and price for this one?" (Enter details for each product).
4.  **Show Them the Portal:**
    *   "Great, you're all set up. Let me show you how you'll verify an order."
    *   (Log in to the Shop Portal on your phone or theirs).
    *   "When a customer comes in, you'll just open this page, type in their code, and tap 'Verify'. The screen will turn green, and you're done. It's that easy."
